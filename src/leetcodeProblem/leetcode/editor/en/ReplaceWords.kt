//In English, we have a concept called root, which can be followed by some
//other word to form another longer word - let's call this word successor. For example,
// when the root "an" is followed by the successor word "other", we can form a 
//new word "another". 
//
// Given a dictionary consisting of many roots and a sentence consisting of 
//words separated by spaces, replace all the successors in the sentence with the root 
//forming it. If a successor can be replaced by more than one root, replace it 
//with the root that has the shortest length. 
//
// Return the sentence after the replacement. 
//
// 
// Example 1: 
// Input: dictionary = ["cat","bat","rat"], sentence = "the cattle was rattled 
//by the battery"
//Output: "the cat was rat by the bat"
// Example 2: 
// Input: dictionary = ["a","b","c"], sentence = "aadsfasf absbs bbab cadsfafs"
//Output: "a a b c"
// Example 3: 
// Input: dictionary = ["a", "aa", "aaa", "aaaa"], sentence = "a aa a aaaa aaa 
//aaa aaa aaaaaa bbb baba ababa"
//Output: "a a a a a a a a bbb baba a"
// Example 4: 
// Input: dictionary = ["catt","cat","bat","rat"], sentence = "the cattle was 
//rattled by the battery"
//Output: "the cat was rat by the bat"
// Example 5: 
// Input: dictionary = ["ac","ab"], sentence = "it is abnormal that this 
//solution is accepted"
//Output: "it is ab that this solution is ac"
// 
// 
// Constraints: 
//
// 
// 1 <= dictionary.length <= 1000 
// 1 <= dictionary[i].length <= 100 
// dictionary[i] consists of only lower-case letters. 
// 1 <= sentence.length <= 10^6 
// sentence consists of only lower-case letters and spaces. 
// The number of words in sentence is in the range [1, 1000] 
// The length of each word in sentence is in the range [1, 1000] 
// Each two consecutive words in sentence will be separated by exactly one 
//space. 
// sentence does not have leading or trailing spaces.
