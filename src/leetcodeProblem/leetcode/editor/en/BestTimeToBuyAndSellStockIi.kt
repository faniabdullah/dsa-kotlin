//You are given an integer array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given
//stock on the iᵗʰ day. 
//
// On each day, you may decide to buy and/or sell the stock. You can only hold 
//at most one share of the stock at any time. However, you can buy it then 
//immediately sell it on the same day. 
//
// Find and return the maximum profit you can achieve. 
//
// 
// Example 1: 
//
// 
//Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
//Output: 7
//Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 3 (price = 5), profit = 
//5-1 = 4.
//Then buy on day 4 (price = 3) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-3 = 3.
//
//Total profit is 4 + 3 = 7.
// 
//
// Example 2: 
//
// 
//Input: prices = [1,2,3,4,5]
//Output: 4
//Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 
//5-1 = 4.
//Total profit is 4.
// 
//
// Example 3: 
//
// 
//Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
//Output: 0
//Explanation: There is no way to make a positive profit, so we never buy the 
//stock to achieve the maximum profit of 0.
// 
//
// 
// Constraints: 
//
// 
// 1 <= prices.length <= 3 * 10⁴ 
// 0 <= prices[i] <= 10⁴
